With Wassword you can easily generate complex passwords and use them for your online accounts. Choose length and chars to be used and generate your passwords safely.

Everything works offline and nothing is shared, your safety comes first.

**Wassword isn't a password manager, it doesn't store generated password. Wassword only creates password!**
